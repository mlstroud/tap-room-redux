## Redux Refactor
|  |  |
|--|--|
| :heavy_check_mark: | Move masterKegList to redux store. |
| :heavy_check_mark: | Move form boolean to redux store. |
| :heavy_check_mark:| Move editing boolean to redux store. |
| | Add selected keg to redux store. |
|:heavy_check_mark: | Add action creators. |
|:heavy_check_mark: | Add action constants. |
| :heavy_check_mark: | Add proptypes for redux props. |

## User Stories
|  |  |
|--|--|
| :heavy_check_mark: | As a user, I want to see a list/menu of all available kegs. For each keg, I want to see its name, brand, price and alcoholContent |
| :heavy_check_mark: |As a user, I want to submit a form to add a new keg to a list. |
| :heavy_check_mark: |As a user, I want to be able to click on a keg to see its detail page. |
| :heavy_check_mark: |As a user, I want to see how many pints are left in a keg. Hint: A full keg has roughly 124 pints. |
| :heavy_check_mark: |As a user, I want to be able to click a button next to a keg whenever I sell a pint of it. This should decrease the number of pints left by 1. Pints should not be able to go below 0. |

## Stretch Goals
|  |  |
|--|--|
| :heavy_check_mark: |As a user, I want the option to edit a keg's properties after entering them just in case I make a mistake. |
| :heavy_check_mark: |As a user, I want to be able to delete a keg. |
| :heavy_check_mark: | As a user, I want a keg to update to say "Out of Stock" once it's empty. |
| :heavy_check_mark: | As a user, I want kegs with less than 10 pints to include a message that says "Almost Empty" so I can try a pint before it's gone! |
| |As a user, I want to have kegs prices to be color-coded for easy readability. This could be based on their price, the style of beer, or the amount of pints left. |
| |As a user, I want this application to be nicely styled. (Use stylesheets and CSS objects!) |

## Known Bugs

* Unable to get redux state to work with selected keg. Tried multiple approaches including writing custom combineReducer function. Bugs introduced only appeared on certain pages, without any immediate explanation, so for now selected keg is stored in local state.
